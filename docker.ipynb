    "## Introduction to Docker\n",
    "\n",
    "Docker is an essential tool in modern software development that solves environment consistency problems across different machines and deployment scenarios.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why Docker is Important:**\n",
    "- Crucial for Open Source contributions\n",
    "- Essential for Microservices architecture\n",
    "- Must-have skill for Developers, DevOps Engineers, and Full Stack Engineers\n",
    "- Used by virtually every repository today\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Development Environment Challenge\n",
    "\n",
    "**Scenario:** Two developers working on the same project\n",
    "\n",
    "**Developer 1 Environment:**\n",
    "- Windows OS\n",
    "- Node.js version 16\n",
    "- MongoDB version 5\n",
    "- Redis version 6\n",
    "\n",
    "**Developer 2 Environment:**\n",
    "- Mac OS\n",
    "- Node.js version 20 (latest)\n",
    "- MongoDB version 7 (latest)\n",
    "- Redis version 7 (latest)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Problems Encountered:**\n",
    "1. **Environment Replication Difficulty**: Hard to remember and communicate all dependencies\n",
    "2. **Version Conflicts**: Different versions cause application failures\n",
    "3. **OS-Specific Issues**: Some tools only work on specific operating systems\n",
    "4. **Cloud Deployment Challenges**: Same configuration issues repeat in production\n",
    "5. **Team Scaling Problems**: Impossible to manually configure environments for large teams\n",
    "\n",
    "### How Docker Solves These Problems\n",
    "- Creates isolated containers with consistent environments\n",
    "- Allows sharing of container configurations\n",
    "- Ensures \"works on my machine\" becomes \"works everywhere\"\n",
    "- Lightweight and portable across different systems\n",

    "## Installation\n",
    "\n",
    "### Steps to Install Docker\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Download Docker Desktop**\n",
    "   - Visit [docker.com](https://docker.com)\n",
    "   - Download for your OS (Windows/Mac/Linux)\n",
    "   - Includes both Docker CLI and Docker Desktop GUI\n",

    "\n",
    "### 1. Images vs Containers\n",
    "\n",
    "**Images:**\n",
    "- Template/blueprint for containers\n",
    "- Like an operating system snapshot\n",
    "- Contains application code, dependencies, and configuration\n",
    "- Stored locally or on Docker Hub\n",
    "\n",
    "**Containers:**\n",
    "- Running instances of images\n",
    "- Isolated execution environments\n",
    "- Lightweight and portable\n",
    "- Multiple containers can run from the same image\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Docker Hub\n",
    "- Public registry for Docker images (like GitHub for code)\n",
    "- Contains official and community images\n",
    "- Source for pulling base images\n",

    "### Network Drivers Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Docker provides different network drivers for container communication:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Network Type | Description | Use Case |\n",
    "|-------------|-------------|----------|\n",
    "| **Bridge** | Default network driver | Isolated container communication |\n",
    "| **Host** | Uses host's network directly | Better performance, no port mapping needed |\n",
    "| **None** | No network access | Completely isolated containers |\n",
    "| **Custom** | User-defined networks | Advanced container communication |\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Bridge Network (Default)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Characteristics:**\n",
    "- Default network driver\n",
    "- Creates isolated network bridge between host and containers\n",
    "- Containers get automatic IP assignment\n",
    "- Requires port mapping for external access\n",
    "\n",
    "**Commands:**\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "# Inspect bridge network\n",
    "docker network inspect bridge\n",
    "\n",
    "# List all networks\n",
    "docker network ls\n",
    "\n",
    "# Run container with default bridge network\n",
    "docker run -it busybox\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Host Network\n",
    "\n",
    "**Characteristics:**\n",
    "- Container uses host's network directly\n",
    "- No port mapping required\n",
    "- Better performance\n",
    "- Direct localhost access\n",
    "\n",
    "**Commands:**\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "# Run container in host network mode\n",
    "docker run -it --network=host busybox\n",
    "\n",
    "# Example: Server running on port 3000 in container is directly accessible at localhost:3000\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. None Network\n",
    "\n",
    "**Characteristics:**\n",
    "- Complete network isolation\n",
    "- No internet access\n",
    "- No container communication\n",

    "```bash\n",
    "# Run container with no network\n",
    "docker run -it --network=none busybox\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Custom Networks\n",
    "\n",
    "**Benefits:**\n",
    "- Container communication using container names\n",
    "- Automatic DNS resolution\n",
    "- Better isolation and security\n",
    "\n",
    "**Commands:**\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "# Create custom bridge network\n",
    "docker network create --driver=bridge my_custom_network\n",

    "## Volume Mounting\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Problem: Ephemeral Container Storage\n",
    "\n",
    "Containers are ephemeral - when destroyed, all data is lost.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Solution: Docker Volumes\n",
    "\n",
    "**Types of Volume Mounting:**\n",
    "1. **Bind Mounts**: Mount host directories\n",
    "2. **Named Volumes**: Docker-managed volumes\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Bind Mounts\n",
    "\n",
    "**Commands:**\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "# Mount host directory to container\n",
    "docker run -it -v /host/path:/container/path busybox\n",
    "\n",
    "# Practical example\n",
    "docker run -it -v ~/Desktop/test-folder:/home/abc busybox\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example Workflow:**\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "# Create test folder on host\n",
    "mkdir ~/Desktop/test-folder\n",
    "\n",
    "# Run container with volume mount\n",
    "docker run -it -v ~/Desktop/test-folder:/home/abc busybox\n",
    "\n",
    "# Inside container, create files\n",
    "cd /home/abc\n",
    "touch hello-from-docker.txt\n",
    "echo \"Hello World\" > index.js\n",
    "\n",
    "# Files automatically appear on host\n",
    "# Even if container is destroyed, data persists on host\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Named Volumes\n",
    "\n",
    "**Commands:**\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "# Create named volume\n",
    "docker volume create my-volume\n",
    "\n",
    "# Use named volume in container\n",
    "docker run -it -v my-volume:/app/data busybox\n",
    "\n",
    "# List volumes\n",
    "docker volume ls\n",
    "\n",
    "# Inspect volume\n",
    "docker volume inspect my-volume\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Benefits of Volume Mounting\n",
    "- **Data Persistence**: Data survives container destruction\n",
    "- **Development**: Live code changes without rebuilding\n",
    "- **Backup**: Easy data backup and restoration\n",
    "- **Sharing**: Multiple containers can share volumes\n",

    "**Optimized Approach:**\n",
    "```dockerfile\n",
    "FROM node:18\n",
    "WORKDIR /app\n",
